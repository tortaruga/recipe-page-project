## Overview

I hope I got the colors right... There are a few shades that look the same to me...

## My process

My process indeed. I should start having a process. It would save me so much time. I just dive into it and then I keep going back and forth between the design file and the coding. Maybe taking a moment to plan things out and starting with a clearer idea of what we're going to do would be a smarter way to go about it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned that I know less that I thought ðŸ˜…

- I thought I was familiar enough with semantic tags but I almost had a stroke trying to decide which ones to use for each content.

- You shouldn't skip a heading (until now I always went from h1 to h3! Sorry h2, nothing personal!).

- I can commit to gitHub from VS Code with no need to always go from the desktop app to the code editor! This feature I'm not going to use tho, because my computer implodes when trying to authenticate me, but it was still nice to find out.

- I used a table! ðŸŽ‰ I never used a table before because they confuse me, and as we all know you should always avoid learning new things like the plague, because they make you feel all uncomfortable and frustrated.

### Continued development

I want to try and be more organized in future projects because I feel like I waste a lot of time doing very simple things that could be done much faster. 

I should also be more mindful about which tags to useâ€”I always use a generic div for everythingâ€”and I should stop just avoiding things I'm not good at... ðŸ˜…

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Repeatedly saved my life clearing all my doubts regarding the difference between a section and an article, or how the hell to style the bullets of an unordered list, or how on earth you build a table (tables are my nemesis).
